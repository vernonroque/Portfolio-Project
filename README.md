# Portfolio Project #

## Introduction ##
____________________
This is a simple portfolio project that introduces who I am and tells a little bit about my background. It also highlights some of the projects that I made using particular technologies such html, css, and javascript. In this project I used html, css, and javascript together to design this webpage. It's the first time I have implemented javascript with html and css so it was really awesome when I actually did it! Little by little, I'm learning how to make webpages a little more interactive :)

I also made this project responsive. It will adjust to any screen size.
